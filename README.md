# NumericalMethods
A Java-based implementation of core Numerical Methods, including root-finding techniques (Bisection, Regula Falsi, Newton–Raphson, Secant), linear system solvers (Gauss Elimination, Gauss-Jordan, Gauss-Seidel, Jacobi, LU Decomposition), and polynomial interpolation (Lagrange). Designed for learning, experimentation, and academic use.
